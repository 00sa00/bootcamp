## Calculator Exercise

Our goal is to create a calculator that looks exactly like this image:

We will work on creating a calculator for next week's work with JavaScript.

A few things to know about this calculator:

- To get the symbols for math, you will need to look up their HTML codes. One place to do that is here:

- The calculator buttons should be clickable. Next week, you'll program them. But for right now, somehow we need to code clickable buttons.

- Colors used in this design include:

* black: #000000
* white: #ffffff
* light grey: #d8d9db
* buttons on hover: #ebebeb
* button active state: #bbbcbe
* function buttons: #df974c
* function buttons on hover: #dfb07e
* function button active state: #dd8d37

- The overall width of this calculator is 400px.

#### Suggested approach:

- Create a wrapper with a width of 400px to set up the calculator.
- Determine how many rows and columns we need.
- Identify elements that occupy more than one column.
- Determine the HTML tags required to code rows and cells.
- Code a single row of 4 elements to start with and see if you can get that working.
- Now add the other rows of 4 elements.
- Finally, add the rows where there are fewer than 4 elements. What do you need to adjust to get these to work?
- Once your layout is mostly working, add the colors and make it pretty.
