That would like something like this: <code class=\"language-text\">expect(addTwo(5)).toEqual(7)</code>. As long as your tests pass, you can deploy new code with confidence that you didn't break old things in the process of launching new code. It's a failsafe of sorts.</p>\n<p>In this exercise, I wrote a bunch of tests that you need to make pass. You will not need to write any HTML or CSS. In the preview window, you'll see a summary of how many tests you have made pass and how many are still failing. The best approach here is to tackle each test one-at-a-time and ignore the others. You can even make other tests not run by changing the test-calling functions to be <code class=\"language-text\">xdescribe</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">xit</code> or you can only one test/suite run by changing them to <code class=\"language-text\">fdescribe</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">fit</code>, just remember to change them all back to <code class=\"language-text\">it</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">describe</code>.</p>\n<p>These tests are hard. Be prepared for that. You're finished when you make all your tests pass.</p>\n<p>The sorting one is particularly tough.
